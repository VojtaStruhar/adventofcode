# Advent of Code

This repo contains all tasks I ever did for Advent of Code.

- 2023: Swift, Lua
- 2022: Go

## Purpose

> When you are learning a new language, you do the obligatory _Hello world_ example - and then what?

I find that the AOC tasks are really good for this kind of thing. Just to get a feel for the language and practise algorithms a little bit.
